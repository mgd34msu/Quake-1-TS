Ported from QW/client/client.h (GNU GPL v2 or later).

client.h -- the QuakeWorld-only members of the client's shared state.

Ruling (PORTING.md's QuakeWorld track, "Client state is a superset"): WinQuake's
`ClientStateT`/`ClientStaticT` (src/client/client.ts) keep every WinQuake field
and gain one `qw` member each, holding the fields QW's client_state_t/
client_static_t add that WinQuake's versions do not have. Every field already
present on the shared classes (movemessages, stats, item_gettime, faceanimtime,
cshifts/prev_cshifts, viewangles, time, pitchvel/nodrift/driftmove/laststop,
crouch, paused, intermission, completed_time, model_precache/sound_precache,
levelname, worldmodel, free_efrags, num_entities, num_statics, cdtrack, viewent,
demonum, demos, demorecording/demoplayback/timedemo, demofile,
td_lastframe/td_startframe/td_starttime) is read from `cl`/`cls` directly by QW
code too, not duplicated here.

This module imports nothing from src/client/client.ts (avoiding the import
cycle that a value import the other way already resolves) -- only
src/common/*, src/qw/protocol.ts (this track's own foundation module) and
src/client/vid.ts, which is a leaf module (no imports of its own) already used
the same way by src/client/client.ts's own `ScoreboardT.translations`.

Deviations from PORTING.md / the C source:
- `cactive_t` gains no new type here: PORTING.md's ruling appends QW's
  `ca_demostart`/`ca_onserver`/`ca_active` to WinQuake's `CactiveT`
  (src/client/client.ts) directly, after `ca_connected`, continuing the
  existing numbering (3, 4, 5). The C's own QW `cactive_t` enum order is
  `ca_disconnected, ca_demostart, ca_connected, ca_onserver, ca_active` (0-4) --
  a different order from WinQuake's `ca_dedicated, ca_disconnected,
  ca_connected` (0-2) that a single shared enum cannot reproduce for both
  trees at once. Ported QW code must compare `cls.state` against the named
  `CactiveT` members, never against a literal number, for this to be safe;
  this deviation is called out again on `CactiveT` itself in client.ts.
- `player_state_t.punchangle` is a single `float` (a view-kick magnitude), not
  the `vec3_t` WinQuake's `ClientStateT.punchangle` is. Since it lives inside
  `PlayerStateT` (per-player prediction state, a QW-only type with no
  WinQuake counterpart) there is no name collision with `cl.punchangle`; both
  exist side by side (`cl.punchangle: Vec3` and, per-player,
  `cl.qw.frames[i].playerstate[j].punchangle: number`).
- `MAX_SCOREBOARDNAME` is redefined locally by QW/client/client.h to 16 (for
  `player_info_t.name`), distinct from src/common/quakedef.ts's
  `MAX_SCOREBOARDNAME` (32, for WinQuake's unrelated `ScoreboardT.name`). Kept
  as a module-local constant here, not exported, so it cannot collide with the
  WinQuake one at any import site.
- `netchan_t netchan` (Q003's src/qw/net_chan.ts, not yet landed) is `unknown`
  here, the same forward-declaration idiom src/client/client.ts already uses
  for `SfxT` pending src/client/sound.ts. Follow-up: once net_chan.ts lands it
  should export the real `NetchanT` and `QwClientStaticExtT.netchan`'s type
  should become a re-export of it.
- `FILE *download` (client_static_t): src/common/common.ts's `FileHandle` is
  this port's `FILE*` stand-in (same idiom as `ClientStaticT.demofile`).
- `skin_t *skin` (player_info_t): skin.c (src/qw/client/skin.ts) has not
  landed. `unknown` here, same forward-declaration idiom as `netchan` above;
  a real `SkinT` re-export is skin.ts's follow-up.
- `char model_name[MAX_MODELS][MAX_QPATH]`/`char sound_name[MAX_SOUNDS][MAX_QPATH]`:
  ported as `string[]` (length MAX_MODELS/MAX_SOUNDS), each entry an empty
  string until CL_ParseModellist/CL_ParseSoundlist (cl_parse.ts, not yet
  landed) fill them in, mirroring a `char[][]` array of empty C strings.
- Dropped: nothing. Every QW-only field of `client_state_t`/`client_static_t`
  listed in client.h is ported below.
