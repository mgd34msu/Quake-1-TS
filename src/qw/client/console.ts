Ported from QW/client/console.h and QW/client/console.c (GNU GPL v2 or later).

console.c -- the scrollback console buffer, its drawing, and Con_Printf's
print/log/echo family -- QuakeWorld's own version.

Ruling (PORTING.md's QuakeWorld track): `diff -w WinQuake/console.c
QW/client/console.c` is 370 of 693 QW lines (~53%), well past the ~40%
fold threshold, and the change is not additive -- QW replaces the flat
`con_text`/`con_current`/`con_x`/`con_backscroll` globals with a `console_t`
struct (`text`/`current`/`x`/`display`), two instances (`con_main`/`con_chat`)
selected by a `con` pointer, and a per-console `Con_Resize`. Wholesale module,
mirroring src/client/console.ts's own idioms (lazy-required client/keys/
screen modules, a small exported holder for reassigned globals, module-scope
statics for values nothing outside this file reads).

Struct/state mapping (QW/client/console.h):
- `console_t { char text[CON_TEXTSIZE]; int current; int x; int display; }`
  -> `class ConsoleT` with `text: Uint8Array`, `current`, `x`, `display`. The
  C's two static instances (`console_t con_main, con_chat;`, plain BSS, so
  `text` starts zero-filled) are `export const con_main = new ConsoleT()`/
  `con_chat = new ConsoleT()` -- no Hunk_AllocName call anywhere in this C
  file (unlike WinQuake's single `con_text`, which the WinQuake unit
  allocates via Hunk_AllocName): QW's two buffers are fixed struct members,
  so a plain zero-filled `Uint8Array` field is the faithful equivalent, and
  this module has no zone.ts dependency at all.
- `int con_ormask`, `console_t *con`, `int con_linewidth`, `int
  con_totallines`, `qboolean con_initialized`, `int con_notifylines` are all
  reassigned from multiple functions in this file (and, per the coordinator's
  wiring note below, from cl_parse.ts's PRINT_CHAT case for `con_ormask`), so
  they become the exported `conState` holder, PORTING.md's "small exported
  holder" rule for reassigned globals. `con_vislines` (assigned by
  Con_DrawConsole, read by Con_DrawInput) is also module-global in the C
  (not a `console_t` field) and joins the same holder for the same reason.
- `con_debuglog`, the function-local `static int cr` in Con_Print, and the
  function-local `static qboolean inupdate` in Con_Printf are read only
  inside this file, so they stay as plain module-level `let`s, not part of
  `conState`.
- `byte *con_chars` and `void Con_DrawCharacter(int,int,int)` are declared in
  console.h but never defined or referenced anywhere in the QW client tree
  (grepped across every QW/client/*.c and *.h) -- dead declarations, dropped
  and reported rather than stubbed.

Function-by-function differences from src/client/console.ts (WinQuake),
each verified directly against QW/client/console.c's own body (not assumed):
- `Con_ToggleConsole_f` and `Con_ToggleChat_f` have IDENTICAL bodies in the
  C (grepped the whole QW/client tree for `con = &con_` and `con_chat`: `con`
  is assigned exactly once, in Con_Init, and never reassigned anywhere else
  in any QW/client file). So `togglechat` does not swap `con` between
  `con_main`/`con_chat` -- it is a plain duplicate of `toggleconsole`, and
  `con_chat` is otherwise-dead state in retail QW 2.33 (still resized by
  Con_CheckResize, never displayed since `con` never points at it). Ported
  bug-for-bug: both functions are separate exports with identical bodies,
  neither touches `conState.con`. (The unit brief's TEST section assumed
  Con_ToggleChat_f swaps `con`; it does not, per the source actually read --
  see this unit's report.)
- Neither toggle function calls SCR_EndLoadingPlaque or falls back to a menu
  when disconnected (WinQuake's Con_ToggleConsole_f does both); QW's own
  body is exactly `Key_ClearTyping(); if (key_dest==key_console) { if
  (cls.state==ca_active) key_dest=key_game; } else key_dest=key_console;
  Con_ClearNotify();` -- nothing else.
- `Con_Print` has no colored-prefix S_LocalSound("misc/talk.wav") call (that
  is WinQuake-only); QW's mask test is only `txt[0]==1 || txt[0]==2 ->
  mask=128`, no sound side effect, no snd_dma dependency.
- `Con_Print`/`Con_DrawConsole`/`Con_DrawNotify` read/write `con->x`,
  `con->current`, `con->text`, `con->display` (whichever console `con`
  currently points at) instead of WinQuake's flat `conState.con_x`/
  `con_current`/`con_text`/`con_backscroll`. There is no `con_backscroll`
  scalar in QW at all -- the backscroll indicator in Con_DrawConsole compares
  `con->display != con->current` directly.
- `Con_CheckResize`/`Con_Resize(console_t*)`: QW's own quirk, preserved
  bug-for-bug -- `Con_Resize` early-returns as soon as the freshly computed
  `(vid.width>>3)-2` equals the *global* `con_linewidth`, which the first
  call (con_main) already updated. So once `vid.width` has a real value,
  `Con_CheckResize`'s second call (con_chat) is a same-width no-op that never
  touches `con_chat.current`/`display` -- only con_main ends up with
  `current`/`display` set to `con_totallines-1` on a normal resize. This
  reproduces exactly (traced by hand against the C, not assumed): the
  `width < 1` branch (video not yet initialized) recomputes the same `width`
  value every call since it does not depend on `con_linewidth`, so it takes
  effect for both consoles there.
- `Con_Init` never calls Hunk_AllocName (see struct mapping above) and has no
  `-condebug` unlink-stale-log step (unlike src/client/console.ts's WinQuake
  version, which drops the same unlink for a different reason -- QW's own C
  simply never has that line).
- `Con_Printf` has NO `cls.state == ca_dedicated` early return at all (QW has
  no dedicated-client concept -- `QW/qwsv` is a wholly separate binary/tree).
  Its screen-update condition is `if (cls.state != ca_active)`, not
  WinQuake's `cls.signon != SIGNONS && !scr_disabled_for_loading`. Also no
  `host_initialized` check anywhere in this function (read directly; absent).
- `Con_DPrintf` reads QW's own `developer` cvar directly via a lazy require of
  `./cl_main` (which already exports it, `export const developer = new
  CvarT("developer", "0")`), rather than WinQuake's console.ts's
  `setDeveloper()` registration-hook indirection: cl_main.ts lives in this
  same directory and is already one of this file's lazy-required siblings
  (for `clMainState.realtime`), so no extra wiring hook is needed. Reported
  as a deliberate simplification, not an oversight.
- `Con_DrawInput`'s guard is `key_dest != key_console && cls.state ==
  ca_active` (by name, per PORTING.md's CactiveT-numbering warning), not
  WinQuake's `con_forcedup` flag, which QW does not have. The cursor row is
  `con_vislines - 22`, not WinQuake's `-16` (QW's console layout reserves two
  extra text rows below the divider bar for... whatever id's layout tuning
  was -- ported as the literal constant). `y = con_vislines-22;` is computed
  in the C but never read (the loop below uses the literal expression again,
  not `y`) -- same dead store src/client/console.ts's own header notes for
  its own `-16` version; dropped here too, not carried as an unused local.
  The cursor-into-key_lines/restore-afterward idiom is the same scratch-copy
  substitution src/client/console.ts's header documents (key_lines entries
  are immutable strings in this port).
- `Con_DrawNotify`'s chat-mode line distinguishes `chat_team` ("say_team:",
  skip=11) from the non-team case ("say:", skip=5); WinQuake has no
  chat_team and always draws "say:". `chat_team` is QW/client/keys.c's own
  global; this port's src/client/keys.ts names the same field
  `keyState.team_message` (its own file header: "team_message is named
  chat_team in QW's C") -- no separate `chat_team` export exists or is
  needed. QW's C also right-truncates the chat line against `chat_bufferlen`
  (a `static int` private to Key_Message in keys.c); keys.ts keeps the
  matching counter as its own module-private `let chat_bufferlen`, not
  exported. `keyState.chat_buffer.length` is used here in its place (the two
  values are kept in lockstep by every keys.ts write site, per keys.ts's own
  header), and the missing export is reported as a coordinator follow-up
  rather than reached into keys.ts to add (out of this unit's SCOPE).
- `Con_DrawConsole(int lines)` drops WinQuake's `drawinput` parameter
  entirely (QW's header declares only `Con_DrawConsole (int lines)`) and
  always calls Con_DrawInput at the end, unconditionally. The backscroll
  arrows are drawn when `con->display != con->current` (a per-console
  field), not WinQuake's `con_backscroll` counter. The download-bar block
  (`cls.download`/`downloadname`/`downloadpercent`, QW-only) reads
  `cls.qw.download`/`downloadname`/`downloadpercent`
  (src/qw/client/client.ts's `QwClientStaticExtT`); WinQuake's Con_DrawConsole
  has no such block at all. `strrchr(name,'/')` is `lastIndexOf("/")` +
  slice; the C's `y`/`x`/`i`/`j`/`n` locals are reused across two unrelated
  purposes (a screen coordinate, then a progress-bar width) inside the same
  function -- given clearer names here (`barBase`/`barWidth`/`barY`) with the
  exact same arithmetic, including the truncating integer division
  (`Math.trunc` at each `/` the C performs on ints).
- The `"QuakeWorld %1.2f"`/`VERSION` string the task brief asked to verify is
  NOT drawn by console.c at all -- it lives in QW/client/draw.c's/gl_draw.c's
  own `Draw_ConsoleBackground` (grepped: `Con_DrawConsole`'s only two call
  sites, screen.c:565 and gl_screen.c:592, both just call
  `Con_DrawConsole(scr_con_current)`; VERSION only appears in draw.c/
  gl_draw.c/menu.c). Nothing for this module to do beyond calling
  `getRenderer().Draw_ConsoleBackground(lines)`, exactly as WinQuake's does.
- `Con_NotifyBox`'s border strings (`"\35\36...\37\n"`) are reproduced
  byte-for-byte: recounted directly from the C (both call sites), 1 byte
  0x1d, exactly 35 bytes 0x1e, 1 byte 0x1f -- identical count on both call
  sites (an initial hand-count suggested otherwise; a byte-exact recount
  settled it at 35/35).
- `Con_SafePrintf` exists in this file (QW/client/console.c lines 678-692)
  and is ported identically to WinQuake's (temporarily forces
  `scr_disabled_for_loading`, calls Con_Printf, restores it).

Import-cycle discipline (PORTING.md's "less fundamental module resolves
lazily" rule, mirroring src/client/console.ts's own header): src/client/
client.ts (`cls`/`CactiveT`), ./cl_main.ts (`clMainState.realtime`,
`developer`), src/client/keys.ts (`keyState`/`KeydestT`/`key_lines`), ./
screen.ts (`SCR_UpdateScreen`) and src/client/render.ts (`getRenderer`) are
each reached only through a lazy `require()` inside function bodies, per this
unit's brief. `src/common/cvar.ts`/`cmd.ts`/`common.ts`/`sprintf.ts` (none of
which import anything under src/qw/) are imported statically at module top,
also per the brief -- confirmed safe by reading each of their own import
lists (cvar.ts/cmd.ts/zone.ts/common.ts all statically import WinQuake's
`../client/console`, never this file, so no cycle reaches back here through
them). `src/client/vid.ts` (no imports of its own) and `src/client/
screen_types.ts` (imports only `./vid`) are the same proven-leaf pair
WinQuake's console.ts already imports statically.

Coordinator wiring (this unit's SCOPE is only this file and its test; every
item below is a path/signature change in ANOTHER file, listed for whoever
picks up the switch):
- 19 files currently import Con_* names from WinQuake's
  `../../client/console` (or `../client/console` for src/qw/*.ts's direct
  children) as a stand-in for this module: src/qw/pmovetst.ts,
  src/qw/net_udp.ts, src/qw/net_chan.ts, src/qw/common.ts, src/qw/cmd.ts,
  src/qw/client/cl_ents.ts, src/qw/client/cl_pred.ts, src/qw/client/skin.ts,
  src/qw/client/menu.ts, src/qw/client/r_part.ts, src/qw/client/screen.ts,
  src/qw/client/cl_main.ts, src/qw/client/cl_parse.ts,
  src/qw/client/cl_cam.ts, src/qw/client/cl_tent.ts,
  src/qw/client/cl_demo.ts, src/qw/client/cl_input.ts,
  src/qw/server/pr_edict.ts, src/qw/server/pr_exec.ts. Every export this
  file needs from those call sites (Con_Printf, Con_DPrintf, Con_Init,
  Con_Print, Con_CheckResize, Con_ClearNotify, Con_DrawConsole,
  Con_DrawNotify, Con_ToggleConsole_f, conState) exists here under the same
  name, so the switch is a bare import-path change EXCEPT:
  * src/qw/client/screen.ts:418 calls `Con_DrawConsole(scrState.scr_con_current,
    true)` -- this module's `Con_DrawConsole` takes one argument; the `true`
    must be dropped when the path switches (screen.ts's own header already
    flags this exact spot, "console.ts hasn't folded QW's 1-arg
    Con_DrawConsole yet").
  * src/qw/client/screen.ts reads `conState.con_notifylines` and
    `conState.con_initialized`, both present here under the same names on
    the same holder shape; no other change needed there.
  * src/qw/client/cl_parse.ts:1060/1063 have two commented-out
    `// con_ormask = 128;` / `// con_ormask = 0;` lines (its own header:
    "con_ormask = 128 around svc_print's PRINT_CHAT case... dropped and
    reported"); once switched to this module, those become
    `conMod.conState.con_ormask = 128;` / `= 0;` (import `conState` instead
    of a bare `con_ormask`, since a reassigned scalar needs the holder, not a
    live binding).
  * src/qw/client/cl_main.ts's own header note ("con_ormask = 128... has no
    counterpart in src/client/console.ts... Nothing here reads it") is now
    stale in the same way; cl_main.ts itself never reads `con_ormask`, so no
    change needed there beyond the plain import-path switch.
