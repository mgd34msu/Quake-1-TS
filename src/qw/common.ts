common.c -- misc functions used in client and server, and the QuakeWorld
filesystem, for the QuakeWorld track (qwcl/qwsv). Diffed against
WinQuake/common.c and WinQuake/common.h (`diff -w`, both fully read) to
identify every changed line; the ~1072-line difference the unit brief cites
is real but concentrated in a handful of functions -- see the table below.

CORRECTED 2026-09-05 (Task 1, "one filesystem state"): this file used to keep
its OWN copies of `com_argc`/`com_argv`/`com_searchpaths`/`com_gamedir`/
`com_modified`/`static_registered`/`com_filesize`, on the reasoning (see the
file's original header) that src/common/common.ts's own bindings are
read-only `export let`s an importer cannot reassign. That reasoning was
sound as far as it went, but the fix it reached -- a second, parallel copy of
the search path / gamedir / registration state -- was wrong at runtime:
every shared module that walks the filesystem (src/common/model.ts's
Mod_ForName, src/common/wad.ts, src/common/cmd.ts's Cmd_Exec_f, the sound
loader, screenshot paths, ...) calls src/common/common.ts's own
COM_FindFile/COM_LoadFile against src/common/common.ts's own `com_searchpaths`
-- never this module's copy -- so a QW binary that only ever updated this
module's own state would have those shared consumers find nothing at all
once COM_Gamedir ran. Fixed by adding exported setters to
src/common/common.ts (`setComArgc`, `setComArgv`, `setComSearchpaths`,
`setComGamedir`, `setComModified`, `setStaticRegistered`, `setComFilesize`)
that this module's own filesystem functions now call, reassigning THE SAME
state every shared module already reads. `com_base_searchpaths` is not one of
the shared fields -- it has no WinQuake counterpart at all (COM_Gamedir, the
function that reads it, is itself QW-only) -- so it stays a plain module-
local `let` here, same as `com_basedir`/`gamedirfile`/`file_from_pak`.

identical in the QW source; not duplicated here):

                             cleanup: CRC_Block landed in src/common/crc.ts as

QW-SPECIFIC PORTS (written fresh in this file; a genuinely new/changed
function, or one that must operate over this module's own copy of QW-only
state -- `com_basedir`/`gamedirfile`/`com_base_searchpaths`/`file_from_pak`,
which have no WinQuake counterpart to share):
  COM_Parse (drops the WinQuake single-char-token special case), COM_InitArgv,
  COM_AddParm, COM_Init, COM_Path_f, COM_WriteFile, COM_CopyFile,
  COM_FOpenFile, COM_LoadFile (private) + COM_LoadHunkFile/LoadTempFile/
  LoadCacheFile/LoadStackFile, COM_LoadPackFile, COM_AddGameDirectory,
  COM_Gamedir, COM_InitFilesystem, COM_CheckRegistered, Info_ValueForKey,
  Info_RemoveKey, Info_RemovePrefixedKeys, Info_SetValueForStarKey,
  Info_SetValueForKey, Info_Print, chktbl, COM_BlockSequenceCRCByte,
  MSG_WriteAngle (different truncation order, see below), MSG_WriteAngle16,
  MSG_ReadAngle16, MSG_WriteDeltaUsercmd, MSG_ReadDeltaUsercmd,
  MSG_ReadStringLine, MSG_GetReadCount, nullcmd, and this module's own
  QW-only state (com_basedir/gamedirfile/com_base_searchpaths/file_from_pak/
  standard_quake/rogue/hipnotic/msg_suppress_1/registered (cvar)/
  MAX_INFO_STRING/MAX_SERVERINFO_STRING/MAX_LOCALINFO_STRING).

Decision list for Task 1 (each function that duplicated a shared-state
consumer, and why it is re-exported vs. kept as its own QW port over the now-
shared state):
  - COM_CheckParm: identical body in both C files (loop over com_argc/
    com_argv, no other state touched) -- RE-EXPORTED from src/common/common.ts
    once its state reads resolve to the shared bindings.
  - COM_InitArgv: genuinely differs (QW's own 6-entry safeargvs list, drops
    "-dibonly"; no cmdline-text reconstruction, since QW has no `cmdline`
    cvar; no `-rogue`/`-hipnotic` toggling, since QW's COM_InitArgv never had
    that check at all) -- KEPT as its own port, now calling
    `setComArgc`/`setComArgv` instead of reassigning a module-local `let`.
  - COM_AddParm: QW-only, no WinQuake counterpart at all -- KEPT, now via
    `setComArgc`.
  - COM_FindFile/COM_OpenFile/COM_CloseFile: QW's common.c has no functions
    of these names or shapes at all (grepped) -- QW's filesystem model is a
    single COM_FOpenFile that always opens a fresh fd (even for a pack hit,
    via Sys_FileOpenRead), so there is no "handle small enough to share, so
    don't really close it" pack-fd bookkeeping to port; nothing to re-export
    or fork here.
  - COM_FOpenFile: genuinely differs from src/common/common.ts's COM_FindFile
    (no com_cachedir/-cachedir support at all in QW; sets the QW-only
    `file_from_pak` flag; does NOT set com_filesize on the non-pack branch,
    a preserved C bug already documented below; single "handle" mode only,
    no "file" mode) -- KEPT as its own port, over the shared com_searchpaths/
    static_registered (reads) and com_filesize (via `setComFilesize`).
  - COM_LoadFile (private) + the Hunk/Temp/Cache/Stack family: differ because
    they call QW's own COM_FOpenFile, which (per the point above) does not
    always set com_filesize itself, so this wrapper must -- KEPT, via
    `setComFilesize`.
  - COM_LoadPackFile: differs (QW's PAK0_CRC is 52883, not WinQuake's 32981;
    uses Sys_File* primitives rather than node:fs directly) -- KEPT as its
    own port, over the shared com_modified (via `setComModified`).
  - COM_AddGameDirectory: differs (extracts `gamedirfile`, a QW-only global)
    -- KEPT, over the shared com_gamedir/com_searchpaths (via
    `setComGamedir`/`setComSearchpaths`).
  - COM_Gamedir: QW-only, no WinQuake counterpart -- KEPT, over the shared
    com_gamedir/com_searchpaths and this module's own com_basedir/
    gamedirfile/com_base_searchpaths.
  - COM_InitFilesystem: differs completely (id1+qw only; no -cachedir/-rogue/
    -hipnotic/-game/-path handling, all genuinely absent from the QW source,
    not merely dropped by this port) -- KEPT, calling COM_AddGameDirectory
    (which itself now writes the shared state) and reading the shared
    com_searchpaths once, at the end, into this module's own
    com_base_searchpaths.
  - COM_CheckRegistered: differs (no `cmdline` cvar handling since QW has
    none; different Sys_Error text; the com_modified gate is client-only,
    `#ifndef SERVERONLY` in the C) -- KEPT, over the shared com_modified
    (read) and static_registered (via `setStaticRegistered`).
  - COM_WriteFile: differs (QW retries via Sys_mkdir on a failed open, where
    the shared version in src/common/common.ts does not) -- KEPT, reading
    the shared com_gamedir directly (never reassigned here, so no setter
    needed).
  - COM_CopyFile/COM_CreatePath: COM_CreatePath has no state dependency at
    all and is byte-identical -- RE-EXPORTED (already was). COM_CopyFile
    also has no direct dependency on the shared state (it only takes
    explicit netpath/cachepath parameters) but differs in its I/O primitives
    (Sys_File* vs. node:fs) and failure handling from src/common/common.ts's
    own COM_CopyFile -- KEPT as its own port; this difference is orthogonal
    to the state consolidation this task is about.

Deviations from PORTING.md / the C source:
- Q_strcasecmp/Q_strncasecmp: QW/client/common.h reduces these to macros
  calling libc's real `strcasecmp`/`strncasecmp` (a true lexicographic
  comparator, can return positive), whereas WinQuake's common.c hand-rolls
  them as an equality-only test (-1/0, per src/common/common.ts's own
  header). QW's common.c has no function body of its own to port for these
  names (they are header macros only); every call site in this file
  (Info_SetValueForStarKey's "name"/"team" checks) only tests `== 0` vs
  `!= 0`, so the landed WinQuake behavior is observably identical for actual
  usage here. Re-exported rather than reimplemented.
- chktbl[1024+4]: the C's aggregate initializer supplies only 516 explicit
  byte values (32 rows of 16, plus a trailing `0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00` commented
  "// map checksum goes here") for a 1028-element array; C zero-fills every
  element past the last explicit one. The comment's placement is misleading
  (it lands the 4 explicit zeros at indices 512-515, not 1024-1027, since the
  initializer never explicitly reaches index 1024), but the *observable*
  array is identical either way: indices 512-1027 (516 bytes) are all zero,
  whether by the 4 explicit zeros or by C's implicit zero-fill, because both
  produce the same value. Ported as the 512 explicit bytes (extracted
  mechanically from the source, not hand-transcribed, and spot-checked
  against the printed source) followed by 516 zero bytes. Only
  COM_BlockSequenceCRCByte reads this table live; the function that would
  write real map-checksum bytes into chktbl[1024..1027]
  (COM_BlockSequenceCheckByte) is `#if 0`'d out in the C itself (dead code,
  not merely out of scope) and is not ported, matching PORTING.md's `#if 0`
  rule.
- COM_BlockSequenceCRCByte's divisor is `sizeof(chktbl) - 8` (1028-8=1020) in
  the actual C source (QW/client/common.c line ~2239: `p = chktbl +
  (sequence % (sizeof(chktbl) - 8));`), not `- 4` as the unit brief's
  paraphrase states; the source, read directly, is what is ported.
- MSG_WriteAngle's truncation order differs from WinQuake's, a real wire-byte
  difference, not a cosmetic one: WinQuake writes
  `((int)f*256/360) & 255` (cast-then-multiply-then-integer-divide, i.e.
  `Math.trunc((Math.trunc(f) * 256) / 360)`, already ported that way in
  src/common/sizebuf.ts); QW writes `(int)(f*256/360) & 255`
  (multiply-and-divide in floating point, cast once at the end). These give
  different results for many non-integer inputs (e.g. f=1.9: WinQuake's
  order yields (int)1.9=1, 1*256/360=0 by integer division; QW's order
  yields 1.9*256/360=1.351, truncated to 1). Ported fresh as
  `Math.trunc((f * 256) / 360) & 255`. MSG_ReadAngle (8-bit read side) and
  MSG_WriteCoord/MSG_ReadCoord are unchanged from WinQuake's and re-exported.
- MAX_INFO_KEY (named in the unit brief, "the MAX_INFO_KEY 64 limits") does
  not exist anywhere in the QW 2.33 GPL release -- grepped the whole
  QW/client and QW/server trees, no hits outside the QW/qwfwd tree (already
  ruled out of scope). The actual C buffers in Info_ValueForKey/
  Info_RemoveKey/Info_RemovePrefixedKeys/Info_Print are plain 512-byte
  scratch buffers with no named length constant; this port's string-return
  idiom needs no fixed-size buffer at all, so no such constant is declared.
  src/qw/bothdefs.ts's own header independently confirms this same
  not-found result for MAX_INFO_KEY.
- Q_Malloc, named in the unit brief, does not appear anywhere in
  QW/client/common.c or common.h (grepped both); only `Z_Malloc` appears
  (COM_LoadFile's usehunk==0 case, COM_LoadPackFile's directory/pack
  allocations, COM_Gamedir/COM_AddGameDirectory's searchpath_t nodes), which
  PORTING.md's Memory section already collapses to plain allocation with no
  observable behavior beyond the allocation itself -- object literals and
  typed arrays are used directly, no zone.ts import.
- build_number() (QW/client/common.c's own function, returns "days since Oct
  24 1996" for display in menus) is not ported: its only input is `__DATE__`,
  a C-compiler-supplied build-date macro with no TypeScript/bun equivalent,
  and no unit brief bullet asks for it. Dropped per the "a function you
  cannot port faithfully is a reported deviation" rule, not stubbed.
- COM_AddGameDirectory's gamedirfile extraction: the C is
  `if ((p = strrchr(dir, '/')) != NULL) strcpy(gamedirfile, ++p); else
  strcpy(gamedirfile, p);` -- the else branch strcpy's the NULL pointer `p`,
  undefined behavior in the C. It is unreachable in practice: every call site
  in this file (COM_InitFilesystem's `${com_basedir}/id1`/`${com_basedir}/qw`)
  always supplies a `dir` containing at least one '/'. Ported as: fall back to
  the whole string when no '/' is present, rather than replicate a crash.
- COM_FOpenFile's directory-tree (non-pack) branch does not assign
  com_filesize in the C (only the pack branch does -- read directly from the
  source, lines ~1510-1528: the non-pack branch's `return COM_filelength
  (*file);` never touches the `com_filesize` global). This is preserved
  bug-for-bug: COM_FOpenFile itself only sets com_filesize on a pack hit.
  COM_LoadFile (this file's private wrapper, matching `len = com_filesize =
  COM_FOpenFile(path, &h);` in the C) separately assigns com_filesize from
  its own captured return value regardless of which branch matched, exactly
  as the C's call site does.
- COM_FOpenFile's non-pack branch has no failure check on the actual file
  open in the C (`Sys_FileTime` succeeding is trusted, then `fopen` is called
  unconditionally and its result returned uninspected) -- if the open then
  failed, `COM_filelength(NULL)` would be undefined behavior. This port
  checks Sys_FileOpenRead's result and continues the search on failure
  instead of crashing: a disclosed, safer substitute for unreachable-in-
  practice C undefined behavior, the same idiom src/common/sizebuf.ts's
  MSG_ReadFloat header already uses for a similar case.
- COM_WriteFile's C tries `fopen` for write, and only on failure calls
  `Sys_mkdir` then retries, `Sys_Error`ing if that also fails. Ported as a
  try/catch around src/platform/sys.ts's Sys_FileOpenWrite, since that
  function throws (via Sys_Error) on failure rather than returning a NULL-
  equivalent sentinel the way `fopen` does -- the catch stands in for the
  C's `if (!f)` check. The final Sys_Error's message text (if the retry also
  fails) is Sys_FileOpenWrite's own ("Error opening %s: %s"), not the C's
  ("Error opening %s", using `filename` rather than the full `name` path);
  sys.ts is out of this unit's SCOPE to adjust.
- COM_InitFilesystem: QW's version (read directly, lines 1829-1851) only
  handles `-basedir`; there is no `-cachedir`, `-rogue`, `-hipnotic`, `-game`,
  or `-path` handling at all (all absent from the QW source, not merely
  dropped by this port) -- confirmed by grep: `com_cachedir`/`CMDLINE_LENGTH`/
  `com_cmdline` do not appear anywhere in QW/client/common.c or common.h.
  `standard_quake`/`rogue`/`hipnotic` stay declared (QW/client/common.c line
  57) but are never toggled by anything in this file (the `-rogue`/`-hipnotic`
  COM_InitArgv checks that toggle them in WinQuake are simply absent from
  QW's COM_InitArgv) and are ported as fixed constants.
- COM_CheckRegistered: QW's version does not register/set a `cmdline` cvar
  (QW has none -- see above) and its Sys_Error text differs ("You must have
  the registered version to play QuakeWorld" vs WinQuake's "...to use
  modified games"). The `com_modified` gate is wrapped in `#ifndef
  SERVERONLY` in the C: ported as the client path (RULINGS: port CLIENT,
  list SERVERONLY alternatives) -- under SERVERONLY (qwsv), a modified game
  with no gfx/pop.lmp does NOT Sys_Error here at all; it silently proceeds as
  shareware/unregistered. Q017 (qwsv) may need to call this with that
  difference in mind; reported for that unit. The `#if WINDED` dedicated-
  server-only branch WinQuake's COM_CheckRegistered had is entirely absent
  from QW's version (not merely dropped).
- Info_ValueForKey/Info_RemoveKey/Info_RemovePrefixedKeys/
  Info_SetValueForStarKey/Info_SetValueForKey: per RULINGS, the C mutates a
  caller-owned `char *s` buffer in place (Info_ValueForKey excepted, which
  only reads); ported to return a new string instead. Callers (cls.qw.userinfo
  etc., Q001/Q021, not this unit) must assign the return value back into
  their holder field. Info_SetValueForStarKey's SERVERONLY branch
  (`extern cvar_t sv_highchars; ... if (!sv_highchars.value) strip high bits`)
  is dropped per RULINGS (port CLIENT path: unconditionally strip high bits
  unless the key is "name"); Q017 (qwsv) may need `sv_highchars`-gated
  behavior and is expected to override this function or add its own.
- Info_SetValueForStarKey's `strlen(value) - strlen(v) + strlen(s) > maxsize`
  check: in C this is unsigned (size_t) arithmetic, so `strlen(value) -
  strlen(v)` can wrap to a huge value when `v` is longer than `value` before
  `+ strlen(s)` is added back. Unsigned modular addition/subtraction is
  commutative and associative mod 2^64, and since `v` is always a substring
  of `s` (returned by Info_ValueForKey(s, key) on the same `s`), the
  "true" mathematical result `strlen(s) + strlen(value) - strlen(v)` is
  always >= 0 and small, so the wrapped C computation always lands on the
  same bit pattern as that non-negative expression. Ported as ordinary
  (non-wrapping) arithmetic: `value.length - v.length + s.length > maxsize`,
  provably equal to the C's result under that invariant.
- SZ_Alloc/SZ_Free do not exist in QW/client/common.c or common.h at all
  (grepped both; the C's own sizebuf_t allocation now happens elsewhere,
  outside this file's scope -- not ported, not re-exported).
- CvarT's `registered` cvar (`cvar_t registered = {"registered","0"};` in
  QW/client/common.c) has no archive/server/info word set, unlike
  WinQuake's `registered`; QW never registers a `cmdline` cvar (see above).
