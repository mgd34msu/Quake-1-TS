Ported from QW/client/net_chan.c and its half of QW/client/net.h (the
netchan_t struct, Netchan_* prototypes, net_drop, OLD_AVG, MAX_LATENT --
GNU GPL v2 or later).

Q003. Adapted from ../quake-2-ts/src/qcommon/net_chan.ts for the general
module shape (a NetchanT class plus the Netchan_* free functions, cvars via
Cvar_RegisterVariable-style registration, a showpackets/showdrop print
style) -- QW/server's own net_chan.c does not exist; QW/server/makefile
compiles ../client/net_chan.c directly with SERVERONLY defined, so this one
module (like the C) serves both qwcl and qwsv. Confirmed by reading
QW/server/makefile and finding no server-side net_chan.c.

Deviations from the brief / from Quake 2's net_chan.ts:
- MAX_MSGLEN is imported from './bothdefs' (value 1450, bothdefs.h:71).
  src/qw/bothdefs.ts did not exist when this unit started (no src/qw/
  directory existed at all), which would have been the SCOPE-sanctioned
  acceptable-missing-module situation the brief anticipates -- a concurrent
  unit landed it during this session, confirmed to export the same value
  read directly from bothdefs.h, so the import is used as originally
  intended rather than kept as a local fallback.
- netchan_t's field names and Netchan_Process's drop bookkeeping are ported
  exactly as read from net.h/net_chan.c, which differ from what the brief's
  hedged prose guessed: there is no `chan->dropped` field (the brief's TESTS
  section says "dropped counts a gap", but the real struct only has
  `drop_count`, incremented by exactly 1 per drop event -- never by the gap
  size). The gap size itself lands in `net_drop`, a *module-level* global
  (`extern int net_drop;` in net.h), not a per-channel field. Ported
  bug-for-bug: `net_drop` is this module's exported mutable binding;
  `chan.drop_count` only ever counts events. Likewise the two ring-buffer
  fields are named `outgoing_size`/`outgoing_time` in the real struct (the
  brief guessed "incoming_size/incoming_time"); both are written in
  Netchan_Transmit and read only inside the C's own `#if 0` rate-estimator
  block in Netchan_Process, which is dropped per PORTING.md's dead-code rule.
- `#ifndef SERVERONLY`/`#ifdef SERVERONLY` (net_chan.c is compiled twice,
  once per binary, with opposite senses of this define) becomes the runtime
  flag `netchanState.isClient`, per the brief's own ruling. It, plus
  `netchanState.demoplayback` (stands in for `cls.demoplayback`) and
  `netchanState.realtime` (stands in for the bare global `realtime` this
  file reads directly), are set by the QW entry points (src/qw/main_cl.ts /
  src/qw/main_sv.ts) once per frame -- neither is landed yet, so this module
  starts with isClient defaulting true (qwcl's sense) and realtime at 0;
  every exported function reads these fresh on each call, so a caller
  driving them by hand (as the tests do) sees an accurate result.
- `MSG_WriteShort (&send, cls.qport)` reads `qport.value` (this module's own
  registered cvar) instead of a `cls.qport` field. QW/client/cl_main.c:214
  sets `cls.qport = Cvar_VariableValue("qport")` once and never reassigns
  it, so the cvar is the authoritative source cls.qport merely mirrors;
  ClientStaticT's QW extension is not landed, so there is no `cls.qport`
  field to read regardless.
- `#ifdef SERVERONLY if (ServerPaused()) chan->cleartime = realtime;` has no
  home yet (ServerPaused lives in QW/server/sv_main.c, far outside this
  unit's scope). Ported via a registrable hook, `setNetchanServerHooks`,
  matching the existing `setCvarServerHooks` precedent in src/common/
  cvar.ts; with no hook installed (the current state) this branch is simply
  never taken, which is a correct no-op until sv_main.ts lands and installs
  one.
- CvarT is src/common/cvar.ts's class (name, string, archive, server, value,
  next, plus the QuakeWorld-track `flags` field a concurrent unit added
  during this session). showpackets/showdrop/qport are constructed with the
  plain four-arg constructor (no `flags` argument), matching the real C's
  `cvar_t showpackets = {"showpackets", "0"}` initializer, which likewise
  leaves every field but name/string at its zero default.
- Netchan_Init's port RNG (`((int)(getpid()+getuid()*1000) * time(NULL)) &
  0xffff` on Linux, `timeGetTime()*1000 * time(NULL)) & 0xffff` on Windows)
  becomes `Math.floor(Math.random() * 0x10000)`, per the brief's own ruling:
  same 0-65535 output range, no seeded-determinism requirement.

packet header
-------------
31	sequence
1	does this message contain a reliable payload
31	acknowledge sequence
1	acknowledge receipt of even/odd message
16  qport

The remote connection never knows if it missed a reliable message, the
local side detects that it has been dropped by seeing a sequence acknowledge
higher thatn the last reliable sequence, but without the correct evon/odd
bit for the reliable set.

If the sender notices that a reliable message has been dropped, it will be
retransmitted.  It will not be retransmitted again until a message after
the retransmit has been acknowledged and the reliable still failed to get there.

if the sequence number is -1, the packet should be handled without a netcon

The reliable message can be added to at any time by doing
MSG_Write* (&netchan->message, <data>).

If the message buffer is overflowed, either by a single message, or by
multiple frames worth piling up while the last reliable transmit goes
unacknowledged, the netchan signals a fatal error.

Reliable messages are allways placed first in a packet, then the unreliable
message is included if there is sufficient room.

To the receiver, there is no distinction between the reliable and unreliable
parts of the message, they are just processed out as a single larger message.

Illogical packet sequence numbers cause the packet to be dropped, but do
not kill the connection.  This, combined with the tight window of valid
reliable acknowledgement numbers provides protection against malicious
address spoofing.

The qport field is a workaround for bad address translating routers that
sometimes remap the client's source port on a packet during gameplay.

If the base part of the net address matches and the qport matches, then the
channel matches even if the IP port differs.  The IP port should be updated
to the new value before sending out any replies.
