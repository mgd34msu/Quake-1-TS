Ported from QW/client/sys_linux.c's `main()` (GNU GPL v2 or later). The rest
of that file has no port of its own: every other function it defines
(Sys_Init, Sys_Error, Sys_Printf, Sys_Quit, Sys_FileTime, Sys_mkdir,
Sys_DoubleTime, Sys_ConsoleInput, Sys_HighFPPrecision/Sys_LowFPPrecision,
Sys_MakeCodeWriteable) is already in src/platform/sys.ts with a body
identical in effect, so there is no src/qw/sys_cl.ts -- unlike the qwsv side,
whose sys_unix.c carries two cvars (`sys_nostdout`/`sys_extrasleep`) and a
Sys_Init that registers them, which is why src/qw/sys_sv.ts exists. QW's
client sys_linux.c declares one cvar of its own, `sys_linerefresh`, but
nothing in QW/client ever registers or reads it (its `Sys_Init` is an empty
`#if id386` body and the only other occurrence in the whole tree is the
declaration itself), so it is dropped rather than carried into a module
existing only to hold it.

PORTING.md's QuakeWorld track names this module the qwcl process entry point
("one engine, two extra entry points").

Deviations from PORTING.md / the C source:
- `main`'s single body is split into `Sys_Main_Init(argv)` (everything up to
  and including Host_Init) and `Sys_Main_Loop()` (the `while (1)` loop), with
  `runFrames(count, seconds)` as the synchronous frame driver a test uses
  instead, exactly as src/main.ts and src/qw/main_sv.ts split their own
  `main()`s.
- `signal (SIGFPE, SIG_IGN)` is dropped: bun/V8 floating point never raises
  SIGFPE, so there is no hardware trap to mask.
- `parms.membase = malloc (parms.memsize)` has no equivalent: zone.ts's
  Memory_Init takes a size, not a base pointer (PORTING.md's zone rule), so
  `parms.membase` stays at its `QuakeParmsT` default (`null`).
- `noconinput = COM_CheckParm("-noconinput"); if (!noconinput) fcntl (0,
  F_SETFL, ... | FNDELAY);` -- the `noconinput` global is read nowhere else
  in QW/client (grepped across every .c there), and the FNDELAY toggle it
  guards has no port: src/platform/sys.ts's Sys_ConsoleInput drains a line
  queue a background stdin reader fills instead of making fd 0 non-blocking.
  The parm is still consumed here so `-noconinput` is not reported as an
  unknown parm, and its one C effect is documented as absent.
- `parms.basedir = basedir` reads sys_linux.c's own file-scope `char *basedir
  = ".";` (line 44); ported as that literal, exactly as src/main.ts does for
  WinQuake's identical line. `-basedir` overrides it inside COM_InitFilesystem.
- `j = COM_CheckParm("-mem"); parms.memsize = (int) (Q_atof (com_argv[j+1]) *
  1024 * 1024);` keeps `Q_atof` and the `(int)` truncation as `| 0`, the same
  reading src/main.ts and src/qw/main_sv.ts record for their copies.
- The C's `while (1) { newtime = Sys_DoubleTime (); time = newtime - oldtime;
  Host_Frame(time); oldtime = newtime; }` has no yield point at all (qwcl's
  loop, unlike WinQuake's, has no `sys_ticrate` sleep branch -- Host_Frame's
  own `cl_maxfps`/`rate` check is what throttles it). A bare spin would never
  hand control back to Bun's event loop, so src/qw/net_udp.ts's
  `Bun.udpSocket` receive callbacks could never run and CL_ReadPackets would
  see a permanently empty queue. `await Bun.sleep(1)` at the end of every
  iteration is this port's fix, the same one src/main.ts and
  src/qw/main_sv.ts make for the same reason.
- `Sys_DoubleTime` is src/platform/sys.ts's `Sys_FloatTime`.
- Bun's UDP bind is asynchronous where the C's is not, so `Sys_Main_Loop`
  awaits src/qw/net_udp.ts's `NET_Ready()` before its first frame, exactly as
  src/qw/main_sv.ts's loop does. Host_Init's `NET_Init (PORT_CLIENT)` has
  already been called by then; the await only waits for the bind to land.

Link step (what the C's Makefile does and this module has to do by hand):
- Module side-effect imports below stand in for the object files qwcl links.
  src/main.ts's header makes the same point for the WinQuake binary.
- `qw.active = true` (src/common/quakedef.ts) is PORTING.md's runtime
  stand-in for the QW tree, set at the very top of Sys_Main_Init before
  COM_InitArgv, since COM_InitArgv/COM_Init and every cvar registration under
  them read it. `qw.serveronly` stays false: qwcl is the client binary, which
  the qwsv Makefile's `-DSERVERONLY` is precisely not.
- `setHostShutdown(Host_Shutdown)`: src/platform/sys.ts's Sys_Error and
  Sys_Quit call Host_Shutdown, which the C resolves at link time. WinQuake's
  src/common/host.ts registers its own from inside Host_Init; QW's Host_Init
  (src/qw/client/cl_main.ts) has no such line because the C never needed one,
  so the qwcl entry point installs it, before Host_Init, so a Sys_Error
  raised during Host_Init still shuts down.
- `qwConsoleHooks` (src/client/console.ts): the modules both QW binaries
  share -- src/qw/common.ts, cmd.ts, net_chan.ts, net_udp.ts, pmovetst.ts --
  import Con_Printf/Con_DPrintf from WinQuake's console module, since qwsv
  links no console at all and that file's `qw.active` fold is what gives them
  QW's Con_Printf semantics there. In qwcl the C links QW/client/console.c,
  so those same calls must land in THIS console's buffer (`con_main.text`),
  not WinQuake's `con_text` (which no Con_Init ever allocates here). These
  three assignments are that link step; qwsv leaves them null.
- `hostClientHooks.scrUpdateScreen = SCR_UpdateScreen`: src/client/keys.ts
  (shared by both trees, QW/client/keys.c being a near-copy of WinQuake's)
  calls SCR_UpdateScreen through that hook from Key_Console. WinQuake's
  src/client/screen.ts registers its own SCR_UpdateScreen there at module
  load, and it is in this binary's import graph whether or not qwcl wants it
  (src/ref_soft/r_main.ts and src/ref_gl/ref_gl.ts both import `scr_viewsize`
  from it), so without this line a qwcl console keypress would run WinQuake's
  screen code. QW's screen.c is what qwcl links; this points the hook at it.
