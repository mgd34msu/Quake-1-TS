Copyright (C) 1996-1997 Id Software, Inc.
Ported from WinQuake/vid_x.c and WinQuake/gl_vidlinuxglx.c (GNU GPL v2 or
later): VID_Init/VID_Shutdown/VID_Update/VID_SetPalette/VID_ShiftPalette/
VID_SetMode/D_BeginDirectRect/D_EndDirectRect -- the `VidBackend`
implementation src/client/vid.ts declares -- plus the one thing neither C
file has at all: a runtime switch between the software and OpenGL
refreshes (`vid_ref`, PORTING.md's "Runtime and build" section, the one
added cvar) and the mode table/fullscreen-fit machinery that switch needs.
Adapted from ../quake-2-ts/src/platform/vid.ts's VID_CheckChanges/
VID_LoadRefresh shape, re-pointed at this engine's `Renderer`/`ModelLoaderHooks`
seam instead of a dlopen'd refresh DLL (both refreshes are statically linked
here, same as quake-2-ts's).

Folds in what quake-2-ts calls swimp.ts (the 8-bit-buffer-to-SDL-texture
surface): this unit's brief says fold it into vid.ts or say so -- SWimp_* in
quake-2-ts is a five-function file (Init/SetMode/SetPalette/Shutdown/
BeginFrame/EndFrame) that exists only because that port's refresh loads
through a `refimport_t`/`refexport_t` boundary neither renderer here needs;
VID_Init/VID_Update/VID_SetPalette below do that surface's whole job.

THE REGISTRY (what ref_soft/U060 and ref_gl/U071 must call):

  import { registerRenderer } from "../platform/vid";
  registerRenderer("soft", () => mySoftRenderer as Renderer);   // ref_soft
  registerRenderer("gl", () => myGlRenderer as Renderer);       // ref_gl, reads glimp.ts's glimpHolder.current for its GL context

Neither renderer is landed yet, so the registry starts empty: `vid_ref soft`
(the default) with nothing registered fails VID_CheckChanges with
`Sys_Error("vid_ref %s not available (registered: %s)", ...)`, listing
whatever IS registered (nothing, in a build with neither renderer linked).
Every test in this unit registers a fake renderer under "soft" to exercise
the switch without a real one; `Sys_Error` throws `SysError`, so a test can
assert it rather than crash the process.

WHY THERE IS NO Renderer.Shutdown (a documented gap, not an oversight):
render.ts's `Renderer` interface has no teardown method -- Quake 1 never
switches refreshes at runtime in the original engine (GLQUAKE is a
compile-time #define), so no C file ever needed one. A live vid_ref switch
here therefore cannot ask the outgoing renderer to free anything; it only
(a) tears down this file's own platform resources (the SDL window/texture,
or glimp.ts's GL context) and (b) drops the `re.current`/model-hook
references. Any Hunk memory the outgoing renderer allocated (surface cache,
GL texture handles the driver itself must still free through the OS/driver
process teardown) is simply abandoned -- which is exactly what already
happens to every OTHER Hunk allocation in this port between one
Host_ClearMemory and the next (PORTING.md's zone.c ruling: `Hunk_Alloc*`
never frees piecemeal). A vid_ref switch is therefore no less "leaky" than a
level change already is; it is a documented follow-up for whichever unit
lands second (ref_soft or ref_gl) to note anything genuinely OS-owned (e.g.
a GL texture name) that would want an explicit free on the way out.

Deviations from PORTING.md / the C source:
- The mode table (`VID_MODES`) has no vid_x.c/gl_vidlinuxglx.c equivalent at
  all (X11's window is created once at a fixed size; gl_vidlinuxglx.c reads
  a numeric width/height off `-width`/`-height` with no table). Per this
  unit's brief ("RULING: adopt q2ts's flat mode table ... exposed through
  vidMenuHooks"), `VID_MODES` is quake-2-ts's own 21-entry table verbatim
  (320x240 through 3840x2160); `vid_mode` (index into it) and
  `vid_fullscreen` are this port's own added cvars alongside `vid_ref` --
  three new cvars total, all necessary for `vid_ref` to have anything to
  select a resolution/window state from. vid_x.c's own `-width`/`-height`/
  `-winsize` command-line parms still override the table's pick for this
  session, exactly as vid_x.c: `if ((pnum=COM_CheckParm("-width"))) ...`.
  `-window` (gl_vidlinuxglx.c's parm; vid_x.c has none, being always
  windowed) forces windowed regardless of `vid_fullscreen`'s value.
  `-mode` does not exist in either C file and is not invented here.
- `vid.conwidth`/`vid.conheight`: vid_x.c's software path sets both equal to
  `vid.width`/`vid.height` (no `-conwidth`/`-conheight` parms in that file --
  those are gl_vidlinuxglx.c-only, and that file's own version additionally
  clamps to a multiple of 8 and a 320x200 floor for the GL console/HUD
  resolution). This port keeps vid_x.c's simpler always-equal assignment for
  both renderers; `-conwidth`/`-conheight` are not ported (documented gap,
  follow-up for whichever GL unit wants console/HUD decoupled from render
  resolution).
- `vid.fullbright = 256 - LittleLong(*((int*)vid.colormap + 2048))` (both C
  files, identical line): the colormap byte block is little-endian already
  (COM_LoadHunkFile has no endian-swap step of its own in this port), so
  this reads as a plain `DataView.getInt32(8192, true)` at the fixed byte
  offset `2048 * 4`.
- `d_8to24table`'s packing (gl_vidlinuxglx.c's VID_SetPalette: `v = (255<<24)
  + (r<<0) + (g<<8) + (b<<16)`) is R,G,B,A in increasing byte address on a
  little-endian host -- exactly `SDL_PIXELFORMAT_ABGR8888`'s memory layout
  (sdl.ts's texture format) and exactly the padded-xRGB shape
  `SDLVID_ExpandFrame` already expects, so `d_8to24table`'s own
  `ArrayBuffer` is reused as that palette directly (`new Uint8Array(
  d_8to24table.buffer)`) rather than building a second copy. Unlike
  gl_vidlinuxglx.c, index 255's alpha byte is NOT masked to 0 here: that
  mask exists only so a GL *texture* using palette index 255 as a chroma-key
  color reads as transparent, which is ref_gl's own texture-upload path
  (not landed), not this file's framebuffer-to-window blit, which always
  wants every index opaque.
- `st2d_8to16table`/`xlib_rgb16`/the X11 `XStoreColors`/8-bit `PseudoColor`
  path, and the `d_15to8table` nearest-color search gl_vidlinuxglx.c builds
  for 3dfx paletted-texture emulation, have no counterpart: this port's
  window is always presented through an RGBA streaming texture (sdl.ts),
  never an indexed X11 visual, so no 15/16-bit intermediate table is needed.
- `VID_SetMode(modenum, palette)`: render.h/vid.h declare it for "resetting
  to mode 0 ... on memory allocation failures", but grepping the whole
  WinQuake tree shows no caller outside vid_win.c/vid_dos.c/vid_svgalib.c
  themselves (DOS/Win32/SVGAlib's own low-memory recovery path) -- vid_x.c
  and gl_vidlinuxglx.c never define or call it, and no client/server file
  calls it either. Implemented here as a thin re-run of the mode-table
  lookup + platform re-init (so the interface member is not silently absent),
  but unreached in this port's call graph; documented rather than dropped,
  since VidBackend declares it.
- `VID_HandlePause`: "called only on Win32, when pause happens" (vid.h) --
  no-op, matching every non-Win32 backend.
- `VID_LockBuffer`/`VID_UnlockBuffer`: "real functions on Win32, empty macros
  everywhere else" (quakedef.h) -- no-ops.
- `D_BeginDirectRect`/`D_EndDirectRect`: vid_x.c's own bodies are empty
  ("direct drawing of the 'accessing disk' icon isn't supported under
  Linux") -- ported as the same no-ops, not invented.
- SDL is armed (`SDL_SetBackendEnabled(true)`) from inside this file's own
  `VID_Init`, not from src/main.ts (out of this unit's SCOPE): `VID_Init` is
  only ever reached through `hostClientHooks.vidInit`, which host.ts already
  calls only `if (!sysState.isDedicated)`, so a dedicated server never arms
  the backend regardless. Follow-up: main.ts could additionally arm it
  earlier for symmetry with quake-2-ts's own main.ts, but nothing in this
  port's call graph needs that today.

Quake 1 has no registration pass at all: model.c/gl_model.c bake the
renderer's own data straight into model_t while the file is being read --
textures through `ModelLoaderHooks.textureLoaded` (model.c's R_InitSky for
"sky*", gl_model.c's R_InitSky + GL_LoadTexture for everything), alias and
sprite data into `mod->cache` in that renderer's own layout, and lightmaps in
gl_rmisc.c's R_NewMap. GLQUAKE being a compile-time #define, no C file ever
has to hand a level it did not load to a different refresh. So the only way
to do it here is to read every model again with the incoming renderer's hooks
installed, which is exactly what the C's own two map-change primitives do:

  Cache_Flush()   zone.c's "flush" command -- drops every cache_user_t block
                  (alias and sprite data, draw.c's Draw_CachePic pics, QW's
                  Skin_Cache skins), so Mod_LoadModel's `Cache_Check` early
                  return misses and an alias model really is read again.
  Mod_ClearAll()  model.c's own; sets needload on the brush and sprite models
                  so Mod_LoadModel's `needload == NL_PRESENT` early return
                  misses too.

Mod_ForName then reloads INTO THE SAME model_t: Mod_FindName matches on
mod->name before it ever considers an unreferenced slot, and
Mod_LoadBrushModel's submodel loop copies over the "*1".."*N" model_t that
are already in mod_known. That in-place reload is what keeps cl.worldmodel,
cl_entities[0].model, cl.model_precache[], cl_static_entities[].model and the
server's sv.worldmodel/sv.models[] -- the same objects SV_Move walks for
hulls and clipnodes -- valid across the switch, rather than pointing at an
abandoned copy while the renderer draws a different one.

VID_SizeChanged -- the window was resized out from under the running mode
(SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED; src/platform/sdl.ts's pump decodes it and
calls this through the handler it registers below).

There is no C precedent to port: vid_x.c never asks for a resizable window
and ignores ConfigureNotify, and gl_vidlinuxglx.c's window is likewise
created once at the size VID_Init picked, so neither file has any code path
that reacts to the window changing size. On a compositor that resizes the
window anyway (the Wayland report this was written for: a 640x480 mode left
rendering into an 1181x502 drawable, so the frame was cropped and the status
bar and weapon fell off the bottom), the faithful-to-nothing options are to
letterbox or to adopt the new size; this port adopts it, which is the same
thing vid_restart to a new mode already does -- minus the parts of
VID_CheckChanges that cannot be justified here:

  - the renderer is NOT torn down and re-created. The window and, under GL,
    the context are the same objects they were a moment ago, so every
    texture name, every cached pic and the loaded level all stay valid.
    That is what makes this cheap enough to run on the (many) SIZE_CHANGED
    events a drag-resize delivers.
  - `vid_mode` is NOT rewritten. It stays the mode the USER asked for, so
    the video menu keeps showing that selection and the next `vid_restart`
    (or menu Apply) goes back to it. The live size may differ from the
    cvar's, exactly as it already may under SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP.

What IS redone is everything VID_CheckChanges_ derives from the resolution:
the 8-bit framebuffer and its con* aliases, `vid.aspect`, and -- software
only, matching vid_x.c's ResetFrameBuffer, which is the one C function that
does re-allocate these for a new resolution -- the z-buffer and the surface
cache through D_FlushCaches/D_InitCaches. `vid.recalc_refdef` then makes
screen.c's SCR_UpdateScreen re-run SCR_CalcRefdef (which re-derives
r_refdef.vrect and calls Con_CheckResize, so the console reformats to the new
width) and `scr_fullupdate = 0` makes it clear and re-draw the whole screen,
status bar included, instead of leaving the old frame's pixels around the
edges.

  ref_gl's `conback` (gl_draw.ts) is the one renderer-owned object whose SIZE
  is baked in at Draw_Init -- `conback.width = vid.conwidth; conback.height =
  vid.conheight` -- rather than read back per draw, and gl_draw.c's
  Draw_ConsoleBackground then draws it at exactly that size. So after a resize
  the full console (the whole screen, whenever cls.state != ca_active) painted
  only the OLD mode's rectangle and every pixel outside it kept whatever the
  renderer last drew there: the reported "ghosting when the client can't
  render", which a tiling compositor makes the default case by handing a
  640x480 mode a desktop-sized window the moment it is mapped. Measured on a
  live 640x480 -> 1280x720 resize before this call existed: the console
  covered the top-left 640x480 and the remaining 67% of the frame was never
  written.

  ref_soft's Draw_ConsoleBackground re-reads vid.conwidth on every call and
  needs nothing, so this is a GL-only staleness -- but Draw_Init is a
  per-renderer hook (ref_soft.ts installs `() => re.current?.Draw_Init()` for
  both), so re-running it simply re-derives the size against whichever
  renderer is live, with no teardown: the window, the context and every
  loaded model stay exactly as they are, which is what keeps this cheap
  enough for the size events a drag-resize delivers (VID_SizeChanged has
  already dropped every event that does not actually change the resolution).

  Draw_Init registers its own cvars and commands (gl_draw.ts's gl_nobind /
  gl_max_size / gl_picmip / `gl_texturemode`), so the same two windows
  VID_CheckChanges opens around its own re-init have to be open here too, or
  a resize prints the "allready defined" flood and trips Cmd_AddCommand's
  after-host_initialized guard.
