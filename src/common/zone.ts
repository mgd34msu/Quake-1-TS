 memory allocation


H_??? The hunk manages the entire memory block given to quake.  It must be
contiguous.  Memory can be allocated from either the low or high end in a
stack fashion.  The only way memory is released is by resetting one of the
pointers.

Hunk allocations should be given a name, so the Hunk_Print () function
can display usage.

Hunk allocations are guaranteed to be 16 byte aligned.

The video buffers are allocated high to avoid leaving a hole underneath
server allocations when changing to a higher video mode.


Z_??? Zone memory functions used for small, dynamic allocations like text
strings from command input.  There is only about 48K for it, allocated at
the very bottom of the hunk.

Cache_??? Cache memory is for objects that can be dynamically loaded and
can usefully stay persistant between levels.  The size of the cache
fluctuates from level to level.

To allocate a cachable object


Temp_??? Temp memory is used for file loading and surface caching.  The size
of the cache memory is adjusted so that there is a minimum of 512k remaining
for temp memory.


------ Top of Memory -------

high hunk allocations

<--- high hunk reset point held by vid

video buffer

z buffer

surface cache

<--- high hunk used

cachable memory

<--- low hunk used

client and server low hunk allocations

<-- low hunk reset point held by host

startup hunk allocations

Zone block

----- Bottom of Memory -----


Deviations from PORTING.md / the C source (ruled under "Memory (zone.c)"):
- This is a name-preserving wrapper layer, not a real allocator: `Hunk_*`,
  `Cache_*` and `Z_*` keep their names and call sites, but there is no shared
  memory block, no eviction, and no defragmentation. `memzone_t`/`memblock_t`
  (zone.c's private free-list block header, with its ZONEID trash-testing and
  fragment-merge logic) are not ported. `cache_system_t`'s free-list/LRU
  machinery -- `Cache_TryAlloc`, `Cache_FreeLow`, `Cache_FreeHigh`,
  `Cache_MakeLRU`, `Cache_UnlinkLRU`, `Cache_Move`, `Cache_Compact` -- is
  internal to that real allocator and is not ported either.
- `Z_Malloc`/`Z_TagMalloc` return a freshly allocated, zero-filled
  `Uint8Array` of `size` bytes (a `Uint8Array` is already zero-filled on
  construction, so the C's `Q_memset(buf, 0, size)` has nothing left to do).
  `Z_Free` is a no-op: there is no block list to coalesce free space into.
  `Z_ClearZone`/`Z_CheckHeap` are named no-ops. `Z_Print` cannot walk a block
  list that does not exist, so it prints one line saying this port has no
  zone statistics. `Z_DumpHeap` and `Z_FreeMemory` are declared in zone.h but
  have no function body anywhere in zone.c (dead declarations); neither is
  ported.
- `Hunk_Alloc`/`Hunk_AllocName`/`Hunk_HighAllocName`/`Hunk_TempAlloc` each
  return a fresh zero-filled `Uint8Array`. The C rounds the requested size up
  to a 16-byte boundary before adding the `hunk_t` header
  (`sizeof(hunk_t) + ((size+15)&~15)`); this port applies that rounding only
  to the mark counters. The returned array has exactly `size` bytes: in the C
  the padding is invisible (callers only ever index inside `size`), but a
  TypedArray's `length` is observable, and lump loaders (model.ts's visdata/
  lightdata) hand these arrays on as the lump's exact contents.
  `hunk_low_used`/`hunk_high_used` are kept as monotonically increasing
  counters bumped by each alloc's rounded size, so `Hunk_LowMark`/
  `Hunk_HighMark` still return values that increase in call order, which is
  what callers that bracket temporary loads with mark/FreeToMark observe.
  `Hunk_FreeToLowMark`/`Hunk_FreeToHighMark`/`Hunk_Check` are true no-ops:
  they do not rewind the counters, because there is no hunk buffer to
  reclaim -- every allocation already got its own independent `Uint8Array`.
  `Hunk_Print` cannot walk `hunk_t` records that do not exist, so it prints
  one line saying this port has no hunk statistics. The C's `hunk_tempactive`/
  `hunk_tempmark` bookkeeping (which auto-frees the previous temp allocation
  before granting a new one) is dropped along with it: each `Hunk_TempAlloc`
  call here just returns its own fresh buffer, so there is nothing for a
  later call to need to free first.
- `cache_user_t` -> `class CacheUser<T> { data: T | null }`. Because the C's
  `Cache_Alloc` returns a raw `void *` that the caller then fills in, and this
  port has no `void *`, the caller builds its `T` object first and hands it
  to `Cache_Alloc`, which stores it, records `{ name, size }` for
  `Cache_Report`/`Cache_Print` (name truncated to 15 characters, matching
  `cache_system_t.name`'s `char[16]` and the C's
  `strncpy(cs->name, name, sizeof(cs->name)-1)`), and returns it back --
  matching the C's `return Cache_Check(c);` at the end of `Cache_Alloc`.
  `Cache_Check`'s LRU touch (`Cache_UnlinkLRU`/`Cache_MakeLRU`) is dropped:
  there is no LRU list to reorder. `Cache_Flush` (the "flush" console
  command) still calls `Cache_Free` once per registered user, exactly as the
  C's `while (cache_head.next != &cache_head) Cache_Free(...)` loop does; the
  observable behaviour is that every registered user's `data` goes back to
  `null`, so the next `Cache_Check` misses and the caller reloads.
- `Memory_Init(void *buf, int size)` -> `Memory_Init(size: number): void`:
  there is no shared buffer to hand in, so the `buf` parameter is dropped.
  It still resets the hunk counters, still runs `Cache_Init` (which
  registers the "flush" command through `Cmd_AddCommand`, ./cmd, U004) and
  the `-zone` parm arithmetic (`COM_CheckParm`/`com_argv`, ./common, U003) in
  the C's order, and still calls `Hunk_AllocName`/`Z_ClearZone` for the zone
  block, purely so the call order -- part of this port's fidelity per
  PORTING.md -- matches; the resulting size is kept so `Z_Print` can report
  the size that would have been requested. `Q_atoi` is not imported (it is
  not in this unit's import list); `Number.parseInt(str, 10)` substitutes,
  matching `atoi`'s leading-integer parse of the `-zone` value. The C's
  `com_argc` global has no separate export in this unit's import list;
  `com_argv.length` substitutes for it (a real array's length is its count).
- `./cmd` statically imports `Hunk_LowMark`/`Hunk_FreeToLowMark` from this
  file and this file imports `Cmd_AddCommand` from `./cmd`; neither side uses
  the other's values at module-load time (only inside `Cache_Init` and
  `Cmd_Exec_f`), so the static cycle is harmless under live bindings and no
  lazy require is needed (PORTING.md's cycle rule applies only when init breaks).
