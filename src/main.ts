Ported from WinQuake/sys_linux.c's `main()` (GNU GPL v2 or later), plus the
frame-loop expectations host.c's Host_Init/Host_Frame place on their caller.

sys_linux.c's main() is the process entry point for the Linux build: it
builds `quakeparms_t`, hands it to Host_Init, then spins calling Host_Frame
forever. Every other WinQuake platform file (sys_win.c, sys_dos.c, ...) has
its own copy of the same shape; PORTING.md assigns all of them to this one
module.

Deviations from the C:
- `signal (SIGFPE, SIG_IGN)` is dropped: bun/V8 floating point never raises
  SIGFPE (there is no hardware trap to ignore), so there is nothing to mask.
- `parms.membase = malloc (parms.memsize)` has no equivalent: zone.ts's
  Memory_Init takes a size, not a base pointer (PORTING.md's zone rule), so
  `parms.membase` is left at its `QuakeParmsT` default (`null`) and never
  read.
- `fcntl (0, F_SETFL, ... | FNDELAY)` (both call sites -- the one right
  before Host_Init and the one in the `-nostdout`-not-given `else` branch)
  is dropped: platform/sys.ts's Sys_ConsoleInput already documents its own
  non-blocking-stdin replacement (a background stream reader draining into a
  line queue), so there is no FNDELAY toggle for this port to make.
- `main`'s single body is split into `Sys_Main_Init(argv)` (everything up to
  and including the `-nostdout` check) and `Sys_Main_Loop()` (the `while (1)`
  loop), so a test can drive Host_Init/Host_Frame without ever entering the
  infinite loop. `runFrames(count, seconds)` is the synchronous frame driver
  a test uses instead of `Sys_Main_Loop` (mirrors quake-2-ts's src/main.ts).
- The C's `while (1) { ... Host_Frame(time); ... }` spins on Sys_FloatTime
  with no yield point of its own outside the "not time yet" `continue`
  (whose `usleep(1)` becomes `await Bun.sleep(1)` below, unchanged). A spin
  here would never hand control back to Bun's event loop, so a dedicated
  server's `Bun.udpSocket` receive callbacks (net_udp.ts) could never run
  and NET_Poll would see nothing but a permanently empty queue; the same is
  true of a future client build's SDL event pump. `await Bun.sleep(1)` after
  every `Host_Frame` call (not just on the "not time yet" branch) is this
  port's fix, on both the dedicated and listen/client paths.
- `if (time < sys_ticrate.value) { usleep(1); continue; }` -- the actual C
  condition additionally gates on `(vcrFile == -1 || recording)` (playing
  back a recorded `.vcr` file runs at max speed, ignoring sys_ticrate); this
  is ported as written, using net_main.ts's `vcrState` (`vcrFile == -1` ->
  `vcrState.playbackHandle === null`, `recording` -> `vcrState.recording`),
  which is the file's own home for those two globals (see net_main.ts's file
  header). Standing order 4 (bug-for-bug fidelity) over a coordination
  brief's abbreviated pseudocode that dropped this clause.
- `parms.basedir = basedir` reads sys_linux.c's own file-scope
  `char *basedir = ".";` (line 26); ported as the literal `"."` this port's
  main() assigns, exactly as sys_linux.c's compiled-in default -- `-basedir`
  on the command line overrides it inside common.ts's COM_InitFilesystem,
  same as the C.
- `j = COM_CheckParm ("-mem"); if (j) parms.memsize = (int) (Q_atof
  (com_argv[j+1]) * 1024 * 1024);` uses `Q_atof`, not `Q_atoi` (a
  coordination brief said Q_atoi; the actual sys_linux.c source, read in
  full for this unit, uses Q_atof -- ported against the real source per
  standing order 4). The `(int)` cast's truncation is `| 0`, per
  PORTING.md's C-int-arithmetic idiom; this also reproduces the C's 32-bit
  wraparound for a `-mem` value large enough to overflow a signed int,
  which is the original's actual (undefined but reproducible-in-practice)
  behavior, not a new one.
- `net_bsd.c`'s static `net_landrivers[]` initializer (net_udp.ts's
  `udpLandriver`) is registered here, at the top of `Sys_Main_Init`, before
  `Host_Init` -- followups.md's ruling for this unit: "at program
  composition ... NOT inside NET_Init". A local `landriverRegistered` guard
  keeps a test harness that calls `Sys_Main_Init` more than once in one
  process from pushing the same driver into net_main.ts's `net_landrivers[]`
  twice; a real process only ever calls this once, same as the C's one-time
  static initialization.
- `main`'s top-level try/catch is this port's stand-in for the process
  simply calling `exit(1)` from inside `Sys_Error` (platform/sys.ts, which
  throws `SysError` instead so a caller -- here, and every test -- can
  observe it). `Sys_Error` already wrote its message to stderr and ran
  `Host_Shutdown` before throwing (see its own file), so this catch does not
  print it again; anything else escaping this far is not a modeled C exit
  path at all and gets a `Sys_Printf` + `exit(1)` of its own so a boot bug
  never hangs the process silently instead of exiting.
