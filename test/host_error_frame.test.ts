/*
Self-sufficient per standing order 13. Covers the U035/U040 handoff this
unit's brief asked for: does host.ts's `_Host_Frame` try/catch actually sit
at the frame level (matching host.c's `if (setjmp (host_abortserver)) return;`
at the top of `_Host_Frame`), and does the client survive a `Host_Error`
raised mid-frame the way `.orch/e2e/A.md`'s "Second defect" (D2) describes:
`Host_ShutdownServer`/`CL_Disconnect` run, the rest of that frame's client
parse never happens, and the process is still alive and playable afterward.

Everything here reads/writes the real, non-dedicated engine (a listen
server: client and server in one process talking over the loopback net
driver), because D2's `i >= cl.maxclients` crash only happens on the client
side of `CL_ParseServerMessage`, which a `-dedicated` boot never reaches
(test/host.test.ts and test/main_boot.test.ts's fixtures are dedicated-only
for exactly this reason). A listen-server client needs real client assets
(gfx/palette.lmp, gfx.wad's conchars, etc.) that no synthetic fixture in
this tree builds, so this file boots against the real retail basedir the
same way test/net_e2e.test.ts does, and says so loudly if it is missing.

Every process-wide flag Sys_Main_Init/Host_Init touches is captured before
and restored in afterAll, following test/main_boot.test.ts's and
test/net_e2e.test.ts's list (rule 15: `bun test` runs every file in one
process).

The second describe block is the coordinator's follow-up
(`.orch/e2e/B.md`'s B-3: `changelevel` allegedly killing the process with
the same `Sys_Error("i >= cl.maxclients")`). As of this unit's investigation
B-3 no longer reproduces -- see that block's own comment for the evidence
and the reasoning -- so its test is a regression lock, not a repro of a
still-open bug.

The third describe block is a cheap cross-check for QW's own frame loop
(`src/qw/client/cl_main.ts`'s `Host_Frame`), which this unit's brief asked
for "if cheap": QW's `Host_EndGame` is fatal by design (it ends in
`Sys_Error`, unlike WinQuake's recoverable `Host_Error`), but the *frame*
still needs to survive a `HostEndGame` thrown mid-frame the same way
WinQuake's does. It forces the throw from `Cbuf_Execute` (the first call in
QW's `Host_Frame` that this test can safely intercept without a full QW
server/client boot -- everything after it dereferences `cls.qw.netchan`,
which this file never sets up) rather than standing up a whole QW listen
game just to prove where one try/catch sits.

/*
`.orch/e2e/B.md`'s B-3: "changelevel kills the process every time" with the
same `Sys_Error("i >= cl.maxclients")` symptom as A.md's D2, "100%
reproducible" via `bun test/e2e/b_repro_chlvl2.ts "map e1m1" "changelevel
e1m2"`. That script (and its "changelevel e1m1"/"map start" variants from
B.md's matrix) now completes cleanly against this tree -- re-run by hand
under `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy`, all three of B.md's
CRASH rows now print "ALL OK".

The catch-placement investigation above (host.ts's _Host_Frame, cl_main.ts's
CL_Disconnect/CL_ReadFromServer, sv_main.ts's SV_SpawnServer/
SV_SendReconnect/SV_SendServerinfo, net_loop.ts) found nothing to fix: every
one of those already matches its .c original line for line (compared by
hand against WinQuake/host.c, cl_main.c, sv_main.c, net_loop.c while
diagnosing this). What actually made B-3 reproduce was a QuakeC-level
`Host_Error` firing *during* the new
level's entity spawn, mid-`SV_SpawnServer` -- `changelevel`'s target maps
(e1m2, dm2) spawn `func_train`/monster entities whose spawn functions call
`find()` on an unset `.target`/`.targetname` field, which is legal in the
C (an empty `pr_strings` offset, never NULL) but was, before
src/progs/pr_cmds.ts's 2026-09-05 `PF_Find` fix (`.orch/e2e/D.md`'s Defect
B), treated as `PF_Find: bad search string` and thrown as a fatal
`PR_RunError`. That fix removed the spurious `Host_Error` these particular
maps' spawn functions triggered, so `changelevel` no longer touches the
`Host_Error`-mid-spawn path B-3's repro needed at all.

This is not a claim that a `Host_Error` firing mid-`SV_SpawnServer` is
handled incorrectly -- the describe block above proves the general case
(any `Host_Error` mid-frame, anywhere in the call stack `_Host_Frame`
reaches) recovers cleanly. This block is a regression lock for the
specific, previously-crashing repro, so a future change that reintroduces a
spurious mid-spawn error on these maps fails a test instead of silently
regressing.
